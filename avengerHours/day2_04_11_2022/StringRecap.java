    String -> object type sequence of chars.

    string class is a member of java.lang package. no need to import

    There are 2 ways to creat string object;
    1- String literal(mostly used) - String str = "Apple";
    created in String pool in heap memory

    2- new keyword - String str2 = new String ("Apple");
    created in heap directly

    **both are same in terms of usage, but only differs for memory allocation

    String object are immutable which means unchangeable/unmodifiable.

    String a = "apple"; //a new abj is created in str pool in heap
           a="Apple"; // a new obj is created in str pool in heap, not modified from the former version
